## Common Handoff Patterns

### Typical Handoff Sequences in OctoAcme Projects

1. **Initiation Flow**:
   - Business Analyst → Product Manager (requirements)
   - Product Manager → UX Designer (feature specs)

2. **Design & Build Flow**:
   - UX Designer → Developer (design implementation)
   - Developer → QA Automation Specialist (testing)

3. **Release Flow**:
   - QA Automation Specialist → DevOps Engineer (deployment)
   - DevOps Engineer → Product Manager (release verification)

4. **Ongoing Communication**:
   - All roles → Project Manager (status and risks)
   - Project Manager → Stakeholders (updates)

## Tips for Effective Handoffs

1. **Be Proactive**: Don't wait until the last minute to prepare handoff materials
2. **Overcommunicate**: It's better to provide too much context than too little
3. **Use Links**: Reference existing documentation rather than duplicating content
4. **Schedule Time**: Allow time for questions and clarification
5. **Document Verbally Discussed Items**: Write down decisions made in conversation
6. **Follow Up**: Check in after the handoff to ensure smooth transition
7. **Update Project Board**: Move work items to the appropriate status/column
