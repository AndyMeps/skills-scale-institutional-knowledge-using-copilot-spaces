# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team
2. Review and assign roles using [Role Clarification Checklist](templates/role-clarification-checklist.md)
3. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
4. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
5. Define Definition of Done (DoD)
6. Identify dependencies and integration points
7. Create release plan and milestone map
8. Establish handoff processes between roles (see [Work Handoff Template](templates/work-handoff-template.md))
